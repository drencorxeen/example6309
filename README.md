example6309
==========

I'm playing around with writing my first 6309 program.

Eventually I hope this will be the framework for Temple of ROM II.

I'm not in a hurry; I'm relearning things along the way at a slow pace.

### Bugs

Sprite drawing is 6309 only, needs conditional assembly

### Changes

Added conditional assembly for 6809 vs. 6309

Added joystick routine adapted from a code example by Richard Goedeken.

Now moving the joystick moves green lines around.

Okay, now all the dots bounce around randomly.

The joystick button now plays a laser sound.

Fixed joystick fire button debounce with advice from Steve Bjork.

Now there's an explosion when you hit the fire button.

Added spider and fireball animations.

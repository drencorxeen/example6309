example6309
==========

I'm playing around with writing my first 6309 program.

Eventually I hope this will be the framework for Temple of ROM II.

I'm not in a hurry; I'm relearning things along the way at a slow pace.


### Changes

Added conditional assembly for 6809 vs. 6309

Added joystick routine adapted from a code example by Richard Goedeken.

Now moving the joystick moves green lines around.

Okay, now all the dots bounce around randomly.

The joystick button now plays a laser sound.

Fixed joystick fire button debounce with advice from Steve Bjork.

Now there's an explosion when you hit the fire button.

Added spider and fireball animations.

Targeting reticule instead of green lines.

Added new sprite code that's slower but has collision detection

Now draws Temple of ROM walls for the first time!
